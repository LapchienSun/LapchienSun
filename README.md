### Technical Operations & AI Leader  
*Cloud Platforms • SaaS Operations • Applied AI in ITSM*

## 👋 About

Two decades in IT Service Management, cloud platforms, and applied AI. I lead technical operations teams, modernise legacy platforms, and build AI-assisted workflows that solve real problems — including Solvyr, an applied AI engine for ITSM that I designed and shipped to production.

My focus is AI that improves service delivery when applied thoughtfully: better triage, smarter knowledge systems, assisted resolution — without sacrificing explainability, governance, or human oversight.

This GitHub profile shares personal projects, experiments, and examples that reflect my professional interests and approach.

## 🔍 What Drives My Work

**Pragmatic over theoretical** — Solutions that work in production, not just in demos.

**Reliability before new capability** — Uptime and recovery matter more than features.

**Data quality before automation** — Clean data enables everything; dirty data breaks everything.

**Explainability in AI** — If analysts don't trust it, they won't use it.

**Clear operational accountability** — Technology serves people and processes, not the other way around.

## 📦 What You'll Find Here

This profile contains:

- Personal projects exploring AI integration patterns
- Proof-of-concept work and architectural experiments
- Patterns and approaches I'm validating outside of production
- Code that reflects how I think about solving operational problems

Most of my professional work is proprietary, so public repositories here represent personal exploration rather than production systems.
