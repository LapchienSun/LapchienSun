### Technical Operations & AI Leader  
*Cloud • SaaS • Service Operations • Applied AI*

## 👋 About

I’m a Technical Operations leader with over two decades of experience working across IT Service Management, cloud platforms and applied AI in complex, real-world environments.

My background spans operational leadership, platform modernisation and hands-on technical work, with a focus on building reliable service operations, scalable platforms and responsible AI-assisted workflows. I’m particularly interested in how modern data and AI techniques can support — rather than complicate — service delivery and decision-making.

This GitHub profile is used to share personal projects, experiments and examples that reflect my interests and professional approach.

  Exploring pragmatic approaches to modernising platforms while protecting customers, service levels and operational stability.
