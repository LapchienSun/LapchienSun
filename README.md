### Technical Operations & AI Leader

## 👋 About

I'm a technology leader with over two decades of experience in IT Service Management, cloud platforms, and applied AI. My work spans operational leadership, platform modernisation, and hands-on engineering — building reliable service operations and AI-assisted workflows that solve real problems.

I'm particularly interested in how AI can improve service delivery when applied thoughtfully: better triage, smarter knowledge systems, assisted resolution — without sacrificing explainability, governance, or human oversight.

This GitHub profile shares personal projects, experiments, and examples that reflect my professional interests and approach.

## 🔍 What Drives My Work

**Pragmatic over theoretical** — I focus on solutions that work in production, not just in demos.

**Reliability before new capability** — Uptime and recovery matter more than features.

**Data quality before automation** — Clean data enables everything; dirty data breaks everything.

**Explainability in AI** — If analysts don't trust it, they won't use it.

**Clear operational accountability** — Technology serves people and processes, not the other way around.

## 📦 What You'll Find Here

This profile contains:
- Personal projects exploring AI integration patterns
